-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< EXAMPLE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- TODO: Remove the "--" from the below SELECT query and run the query
--    NOTE: When writing queries, make sure each one ends with a semi-colon

SELECT * FROM final_airbnb;



-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out how many rows are in the table "final_airbnb"
select count(*) from final_airbnb;


-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 146


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out the name of the host for "host_id" 63613
-- HINT: "Where" could it be?
select host_name from final_airbnb where host_id = "63613";
-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Patricia


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to just show the unique neighbourhoods listed
-- HINT: This is a "distinct" operation...

select distinct neighbourhood from final_airbnb;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 40 neighbourhoods listed


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 4 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-- Find both the highest price listing and the lowest price listing, displaying the entire row for each
-- HINT: This can be two different queries.

select max(price) as highest_price, min(price) as lowest_price from final_airbnb;


-- FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Think about the results. Are the high and low prices outliers in this data set?

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Highest = 785, Lowest = 55


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the average availability for all listings in the data set (using the availability_365 column)
-- HINT: Aggregates are more than just big rocks...

select avg(availability_365) from final_airbnb;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 165.3904


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 6 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find all listings that do NOT have a review
-- HINT: There are a few ways to go about this. Remember that an empty cell is "no value", but not necessarily NULL

select * from final_airbnb where number_of_reviews = 0;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 6 rows


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 7 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the id of the listing with a room_type of "Private room" that has the most reviews 
-- HINT: Sorting is your friend!

select id from final_airbnb where room_type like "pri%" order by number_of_reviews desc limit 1;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 8 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the most popular neighbourhood for listings 
-- HINT: Look for which neighbourhood appears most frequently in the neighbourhood column
-- HINT: You are creating "summary rows" for each neighbourhood, so you will just see one entry for each neighbourhood

select neighbourhood, count(neighbourhood) as listings from final_airbnb group by neighbourhood order by listings desc limit 1;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Williamsburg
-- INVESTIGATE: Should Williamsburg be crowned the most popular neighbourhood?

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 9 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to discover which listing is the most popular using the reviews_per_month for all listings with a minimum_nights value of less than 7
-- HINT: Sorting is still your friend! So are constraints.
select id from final_airbnb where minimum_nights < 7 order by reviews_per_month desc limit 1;
-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 10 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out which host has the most listings. 
-- Create a NEW column that will show a calculation for how many listings the host for each listing has in the table
-- Display the column using aliasing.
-- HINT: Work this one step at a time. See if you can find a way to just display the count of listings per host first.

select host_name, count(host_name) as listings_per_host from final_airbnb group by host_name order by listings_per_host desc;
-- OR, FOR ONLY ONE RESULT --
-- select host_name, count(host_name) as listings_per_host from final_airbnb group by host_name order by listings_per_host desc limit 1;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: The Box House Hotel with 6 listings


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 11 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< WRAP UP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?
-- Write a few sentences and include them with your project submission in the README file 

-- ****** My response is at the top of the README file as instructed************* 


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ** BONUS ** >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the the percent above or below each listing is compared to the average price for all listings.
-- HINT: No hints! It's a bonus for a reason :)

select id, host_name, neighbourhood, price, round(((price - 165.39)/165.39) * 100) as "%_over_or_under_Avg" from final_airbnb;

-- I was suprised that it just kept letting me add more parenthesis!  And the 'round' keyword was actually my first guess as to how to round the decimals to whole, couldn't believe it.
